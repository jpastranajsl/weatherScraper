#Weather Scraper
My first tiny project in Python - Web Scraping!

I had a great time learning BeautifulSoup while working on this project. This script asks for your input on a city and country (e.g., Mexico City, Mexico) and retrieves the current weather data for that location from Time and Date.

This project is my first step into Python and web scraping, which I believe is a valuable skill for data science. If you have any suggestions to improve this project or are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn (Jimena Pastrana) or via email at jimepastranaj@icloud.com.
